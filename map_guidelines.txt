1. Maps

1.1 Mapmaking packages.
There are two mapmaking packages: plainmaps and sitemaps.
Use the package specified in the prompt.

1.2 Set some options and load the required libraries.
Be sure to load the required libraries. Here is the code:
```r
#| error: false
#| warning: false

library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggmap)
library(gt)

## Set an option for the read_csv function
## This will suppress warning messages.
options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE)
```

1.3 Get mapping packages from GitHub/kimbridges
The following packages are available from github/kimbridges:

- plainmaps     ## Simple maps
- sitemaps      ## Data-based, location maps

Include both packages in the initialization process. 
Here is the code:

```r
## Load special libraries.
install_github("kimbridges/plainmaps")
install_github("kimbridges/sitemaps")

library(plainmaps)
library(sitemaps)
```

1.4 Making a map using either the sitemaps or plainmaps.
If either the sitemaps or plainmaps package is loaded, include
the following code to initialize the access key and establish
some default values.
```r
googleKey <- Sys.getenv("GGMAP_GOOGLE_API_KEY")
register_google(key = googleKey, account_type = "standard")

1.5 Store location data in a variable.
The variable that stores location information, such as the labels 
of locations, lat, and lon, should be called "data".

1.6 Be sure there is a "group" variable.
If the data to be mapped are stored in a variable named "data",
then there needs to be a "data$group <- 1" added to the code
after the data are input. 

1.7 The name for the labels variable must always be "text".
Here is an example.
```r
data <- read_csv(col_names=TRUE, file=
            "text,    lon,     lat
             London,  -0.1278, 51.5074
             Paris,   2.3522,  48.8566")
```
1.8 Add a code for the two basic map themes.
There is a "plain_background_theme" and an
"island_background_theme". The code for the appropriate
theme should be included in the R code.
 
1.9 Add standard setup code for sitemaps and plainmaps.
Use two functions from sitemaps to initialize parameters. Here is the code:
```r
column <- site_styles()
hide  <- site_google_hides()
```

1.10 Some simple theme elements improve the appearance of a map.
The following theme element removes the axis labels and 
puts a border around the map. It also turns off the legend.
Here is the code:
```r
simple_black_box <- theme_void() +
              theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", 
                                   fill=NA, 
                                   size=2),
                    legend.position = "none")
```
1.11 Make sure the map coordinates are not distorted.
The "coord_fixed()" function is generally necessary (except when
very near the equator) to make sure there is minimal distortion.

1.12 Use a new argument to control the linewidths.
The `size` argument of `element_rect()` is deprecated. Use the `linewidth` argument instead.
