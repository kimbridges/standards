## 1. Bar Chart Formatting

### 1.1 Bar outline.
Each bar should have a black outline.

### 1.2 Bar fill colors.
When there is just one variable, use the single color "cornsilk3".
When creating bar charts with multiple variables (e.g., categories or groups), 
use multiple colors with these rules:

- Use "cornsilk3" as the fill color for the bars of the first variable (i.e., single category).
- Use "darkgoldenrod2" as the fill color for the bars of the second variable (if applicable).
- Use "lightsalmon2" as the fill color for the bars of the third variable (if applicable), .
- When more than three variables being plotted, continue with a logical color progression that maintains readability and aesthetic appeal.

### 1.3 Panel background color.
The panel background should be darkslategray2.

### 1.4 Axis labels and scale values.
The axis labels and scale values should be black.
The axis text and axis title should be size=12.

### 1.5 Grid lines.
Use y-axis grid lines and tick marks.
Do not use x-axis grid lines.
Use x-axis tick marks.

### 1.6 Start and end of the y axis.
Unless there are negative y values, the y axis should start at zero.
There should be a small extension of the y axis at the top of the chart so the tallest bar does not hit the top.

### 1.7 Source information.
Identifying the data used in the chart should come from a source statement. 
If a source is not provided, use the term "dummy" as the source. Here is an example.
```r
source <- "dummy"
```
Put the source data into the chart with the "labs(caption = source)" code.

### 1.8 Box plot outliers.
Don't show outlier points in any special way. Here is an example of the code to use:
```r
geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)
```

### 1.9 Box plot data points.
Make the data points red.
Make the data points size 3.
